export const FEEDBACK_PROMPT = `{{conversation}}

Based on the above interview conversation between the assistant and the user (candidate), provide a detailed evaluation of the user's performance.

If the conversation is incomplete, too short, or lacks meaningful technical content, give low ratings (â‰¤3), and set "recommendation" to "No".

Your response must be in strict JSON format with the following structure:

{
  "feedback": {
    "rating": {
      "technicalSkills": <number between 1-10>,
      "communication": <number between 1-10>,
      "problemSolving": <number between 1-10>,
      "experience": <number between 1-10>,
      "total_rating": <average or overall score out of 10>
    },
    "summary": "<A brief summary of the interview in 3 concise lines>",
    "recommendation": "<Yes or No>",
    "recommendationMsg": "<A short sentence explaining whether the candidate is recommended for hiring and why>"
  }
}

Rules:
- If the candidate gave no meaningful responses, or the conversation was interrupted or incomplete, assign low ratings and do not recommend.
- Base your judgment only on the content of the conversation. Do not make assumptions.
- Respond only with the JSON. No extra commentary.
